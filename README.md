# Financial-transaction-analysis-dashboard
Developed a Power BI dashboard for analyzing a large set of financial transactions and drawing useful insights from them.
# Problem statement
Since large number of transactions occur in a day, it is difficult to analyze the data and create useful insights from them. The aim is to analyze the transaction based on the amount, finding the Month-over-month percentage, classifying the data based on card type and geographical conditions. 
# My approach
1. Data extraction with Excel, Power BI
   * Used a dataset which is in the form of Excel and loaded the dataset into Power BI.
2. Data Visualization
   * Used Power BI to create a dash board and view the visuals so that insights can be easily drawn.
# Dataset Information
* Source: Used Kaggle-Financial Transactions Dataset: Analytics(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets)
# How to view the project

2. Connect it to the kaggle Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets)
3. Hit refresh to populte the visuals.
# Techncial skills
