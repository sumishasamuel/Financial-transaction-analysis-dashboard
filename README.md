# Financial-transaction-analysis-dashboard
Developed a Power BI dashboard for analyzing a large set of financial transactions and drawing useful insights from them.
# Problem statement
Since large number of transactions occur in a day, it is difficult to analyze the data and create useful insights from them. The aim is to analyze the tranasaction based on the amount, finding the Month-over-month perecntage, classifying the data based on card type and geographical conditions. 
# My approach
1. Data extraction with Excel, Power BI
   * Used a dataset which is in the form of Excel and loaded the dataset into Power Bi.
2. Data Visualization
   * Used Power BI to create a dash board and view the visuals so that insights can be easily drawn.
# Dataset Information
* Source: Used Kaggle-Financial Transactions Dataset: Analytics(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/computingvictor/transactions-fraud-datasets)
# Key insights and features
* Time-series analysis: Implemented Month-over-month(MoM) growth tracking which can be used for identifying seasonal spending trends.
* Geographic segmenation: Used spatial visualization for finding top spening markets
* Credit Insights: Analyzed credit limit distribution by card type(Debit Vs Credit) to understand liquidity and risk exposure.
# Techncial skills
* DAX: Created DAX expressions for finding MoM growth trends, total spending.
* Data Modelling: Created a star Schema relationship between transaction data and Date table for accurate reporting.
* ETL Process: Cleaned and transformed raw dataset for ensuring data integrity.
* Data visualization: Created a dashboard for visual perception and easiness.
# Outcome
I was able to analyse large amount of data, create a dash board in Power BI for visualizing the data in a financial area.
